In the `code section` we have all of our progress so far with the project.
In the `Final Version of Project folder` has both the `Final Report` and `Final Poster` uploaded there.
In the `Structure folder` it has a file called `Report_empty` which has the general structure of the report before combining our work together.

In the `Projects section` We have structured it in an easy and organized way with the following sections respectively:

- `Project Plan` where it has a link of our Google excel spreadsheet with tasks assigned to each member and signning off sheet and dates of tasks done.

- `To Do section` where it explains how we came up with the structure of the report and how many words each member write and etc.

- `Researched Resources` where we have all the `links` of the resources as a different section for each member.

-`Poster` And just in case we have the `link` of the Google slides that we used in order to do the poster with a timely manner.

`Thanks for reading this #ReadMe`
